| File / Directory | Description |
|:---:|---|
| [1](Factorial.java) | Factorial using Static Method. |
| [2](Fibonacci.java) | Fibonacci using Static Method. |
| [3](MultTable.java) | Multiplication Table. |
| [4](Prime.java) | Prime or Non-Prime. |
| [5](StudentMain.java) | Create a class `Student` with data members `RollNo`, `Name` and `Marks`. Create N objects of the class and generate the ranklist. |
| [6](CPUDemo.java) | Create a class `CPU` with attribute `price`. Create an inner class `Processor` with attributes `no.of cores`and `manufacturer`, and a static nested class `RAM` with attributes `memory` and `manufacturer` inside `CPU`. Create an object of `CPU` and print details of its processor and RAM. |
| [7](ZooDemo.java) | Create class `Zoo` with attributes `name` and `enclosures[]`. Create an inner class called `Enclosure` with attributes `name`, `type` and `animals[]`. Inside `Zoo` create a static nested class `ZooInfo` with attributes `addr` and `phno`. |
| [8](AreaDemo.java) | Using Method overloading compute Areas of `Rectangle (int)`, `Rectangle (double)`, `Square (int)`, `Square (double)`, `Circle (double)`, `Triangle (double)`. |
| [9](VolumeDemo.java) | Using Method overloading compute Volumes of `Cube (double)`, `Cuboid (double)`, `Sphere (double)`, `Cylinder (double)`, `Cone (double)`. |
| [10](AnimalDemo.java) | Create an `Animal` class with a private `species`, friendly `age`, protected `color`, and `weight`. The `Dog` and `Cat` classes inherit from `Animal`, with `Dog` adding private `name` and `owner`, and `Cat` including `name`, `eye color`, and `tail length`. |
| [11](TeacherDemo.java) | Create a class `Person` with data members `Name`, `Gender`, `Address`, and `Age`. Create a class `Employee` that inherits from `Person` with data members `EmpID`, `Company_Name`, `Qualification`, and `Salary`. Create a class `Teacher` that inherits from `Employee` with data members `TeacherID`, `Subject`, and `Department`. Include constructor and a method to display the data members in every class. Demonstrate using N Teachers. |
| [12](AreaMenu.java) | Create an interface with functions `area()` and `perimeter()`. Create two classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` which implements the above interface. Create a menu driven program to find area and perimeter of various objects. |
| [13](RDemo.java) | Create an interface `Printable` with the functions `display()` and `show()`, an interface `Computable` with the functions `area()`, `perimeter()`, and `volume()`, and an interface `Drawable` with the function `draw()`. Create two classes, `Rectangle` and `Sphere`, which implement these interfaces. |
| [14](CompareVolume.java) | Create interface `Comparable` with functions `volume()` and `compareByVolume(Comparable other)`. Create two classes `Cuboid` and `Cylinder` and compare their volumes. |
| [15](PGStudentDemo.java) | Create class `Person(name, gender, phoneno)`. Create an interface `Showable` with `void show()`. Derive class `Student(course, score)` from `Person`. Derive class `PGStudent(researchArea, guide)` from `Student`. Create N PGStudents and <br> (i) rank them based on score <br> (ii) sort them based on researchArea <br> Display the student details using `show()`. |
| [16](DimDemo.java) | Design a functional interface `Dim` having the method `double area(int x)`. Create lambda functions to find the area of <br> (a) Square <br> (b) Cube <br> (c) Circle <br> (d) Sphere |
| [17](GDemo.java) | Create a Java package `geometry` that contains three sub-packages: `interfaces`, `shapes2D`, and `shapes3D`. <br> `interfaces` package defines interfaces: `calcArea` and `calcPerimeter`  <br> `shapes2D` package contains classes: `Circle` and `Rectangle` <br> `shapes3D` package contains classes: `Cuboid` and `Sphere` |
| [18](ADemo.java) | Create an `Arithmetic` package that has classes and interfaces for the basic arithmetic operations. Test the package by implementing all operations on two given numbers. |
